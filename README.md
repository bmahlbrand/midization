midization
==========

parser to produce melodic contour strings of files  

#TODO  
-add key signature detection  
-add multi-track support (currently only midi file type 0 is supported)  
-add melodic subsequence detection  
-add string approximations  
-add note data  
-Python hooks to get melodic contour map from file...just call C from Python for web UI
